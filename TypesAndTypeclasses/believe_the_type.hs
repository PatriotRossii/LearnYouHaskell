-- Overview of some commont types

-- Int stands for integer. It's used for whole numbers. 7 can be an Int but 7.2 cannot. Int is bounded, which means that it has a minimum and a maximum value. Usually on 32-bit machines the maximum possible Int is 2147483647 and the minimum is -2147483648.

-- Integer stands for, er â€¦ also integer. The main difference is that it's not bounded so it can be used to represent really really big numbers. I mean like really big. Int, however, is more efficient.

factorial n = product [1..n]

-- Bool is a boolean type. It can have only two values: True and False.

-- Char represents a character. It's denoted by single quotes. A list of characters is a string.
